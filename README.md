The script shows average salaries for programmers. It takes data from HH and SuperJob.

### How to install

Python3 should be already installed. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

use .env to set SuperJob application ID:
```
APP_ID=YOURAPPID
```
